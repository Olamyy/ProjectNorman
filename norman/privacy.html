            <h2 class="text-center">Our Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
We provide you the right and control over your personal information while visiting our website (www.DrNorman.ai) and through our chatbot product, DrNorman ("DrNorman") irrespective of the communication channel / chat software eg. Slack, Microsoft Skype etc. We acknowledge that personal information, such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, etc. are kept private and confidential. At some point during your visit, you may be required to give that information for internal purposes. Accordingly, the information you provide is stored in a secure location and it is only accessible by designated staff of CollateBox.
</p>
<p>
By accessing the Service (as defined below), you accept this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Services. 
</p>
<p>
<b>The Information We Collect and Store</b>

</p>
<p>Information You Provide. When you register an account, we collect some personal information, such as your name, phone number, third party billing information (eg. Paypal account id), email address and home and business postal addresses (collectively, your "Personal Information"). You may also ask us to import your contacts by giving us access to your third party services (for example, your email account) or to use your social networking information if you give us access to your account on social network connection services (inclusive of chat platforms). You may also provide us with your contacts' email addresses when sharing data with them.</p>
<p>Data: We collect and store the data you copy/paste, upload, link to, download, or access with the DrNorman Service ("Data") . If you add data to your DrNorman that has been previously uploaded by you or another user, we may associate all or a portion of the previous data with your account rather than storing a duplicate.</p>
<p>Log Data: When you use the Service, we automatically record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services. This may include the Device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata concerning your Data, and other interactions with the Service.</p>

These notifications are currently delivered via email and mobile text messages.</p>

In that event, any acquirer will be subject to our obligations under this Privacy Policy, including your rights to access and choice. We will notify you of the change either by sending you an email or posting a notice on our Web site.</p>

<p>The security of your information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at support (at) DrNorman.ai
</p>

<p><b>California Privacy Rights</b></p>
